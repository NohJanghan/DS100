    "### 🚀 Question 1a\n",
    "\n",
    "Define a function `plot_distribution` that takes an array of numbers (integers or decimals) and draws the histogram of the distribution using unit bins centered at the integers and white edges for the bars.\n",
    "\n",
    "The histogram should be drawn to the density scale, and the opacity should be 75%. The left-most bar should be centered at the integer closest to the smallest number in the array, and the right-most bar should be centered around the integer closest to the largest number in the array.\n",
    "\n",
    "The display does not need to include the printed proportions and bins. No titles or labels are required for this question. For grading purposes, assign your plot to `histplot`.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have trouble defining the function, go back and carefully read all the lines of code that resulted in the probability histogram of the number of spots on one roll of a die. Pay special attention to the bins. Feel free to create a cell to test your function on generic arrays to check for correctness!\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hint**: \n",
    "* See `plt.hist()` [documentation](https://matplotlib.org/stable/api/_as_gen/matplotlib.pyplot.hist.html).\n",
    "* We want to: (1) center each bin at integer values and (2) make sure all the values in the array are captured by the bins.\n",
    "    * For example, let’s say we have the following input array: `[0.3, 0.7, 1.1, 1.4, 1.9]`.\n",
    "    * The smallest value is `0.3`; the left endpoint of the leftmost bin (the first bin) should be `-0.5` and the rightmost endpoint of this bin should be `0.5` so that this bin is centered at the integer `0`.\n",
    "    * This first bin above captures `0.3`. The second bin will be centered at `1` (between `0.5` and `1.5`) and captures `0.7`, `1.1`, and `1.4`.\n",
    "    * We can continue in this manner until all values are captured by our bins.\n",
    "* What is the left endpoint of the left-most bar? What is the right endpoint of the right-most bar? You may find `min()`, `max()`, and `round()` helpful.\n",
    "* Please keep in mind your function should be implemented so that it works for _any_ generic array of numbers (integers or decimals), not just the `faces` array in the cell below.\n",
    "* If you implement the function correctly, you should get a plot like this:\n",

In this question, we study one recorded feature in `hearts_df`: serum cholesterol. Serum cholesterol refers to the total amount of cholesterol in one’s blood. Further details about the dataset are discussed in [this Kaggle page](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/heart-failure-prediction).\n",

    "Before we write any code, let’s review the idea of hypothesis testing with the permutation test. It follows the procedure below: \n",
    "1. We first simulate the experiment many times (say, 10,000 times) using [random permutation](https://inferentialthinking.com/chapters/12/1/AB_Testing.html#predicting-the-statistic-under-the-null-hypothesis) (i.e., without replacement) (i.e., under the assumption that the null hypothesis is true). This simulated sampling process produces an empirical distribution of many values of a predetermined test statistic (say, 10,000 values). \n",
    "2. Then, we compare our one true observed test statistic to this empirical distribution of simulated test statistics to compute an empirical p-value. \n",
    "3. Finally, we compare this p-value to a particular cutoff threshold (often, 0.05) to decide whether we fail to reject the null hypothesis.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the cell below, answer the following questions:\n",
    "* What does an empirical p-value from a permutation test mean in this particular context of serum cholesterol and having heart disease?\n",

    "### 🚀 Question 1d\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, we begin the permutation test by generating an array called `differences` that contains simulated values of our test statistic from **10,000 permuted samples**. Again, note that our test statistic differs from what is in the Data 8 textbook: we are computing the **absolute** difference between the average cholesterol levels of patients with heart disease and without heart diseases, where labels have been assigned at random (i.e., in a world where the null hypothesis is true, so disease status is arbitrary and should have no effect on cholesterol).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**: Most of the code below for this problem is already filled for you. In summary, this code first combines the cholesterol values from both groups into one array. Then, it repeatedly (10,000 times) shuffles this combined data to randomly reassign cholesterol values into two new simulated groups of the same original sizes. For each shuffle, it calculates the absolute difference in means between the two simulated groups and stores it.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Reminder**: Data 100 does **not** support the `datascience` library, so you should instead use the appropriate functions from the `NumPy` library. Some suggested references: Lab 01 (for a quick `NumPy` tutorial), `NumPy` array indexing/slicing [documentation](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/user/basics.indexing.html), `np.random.choice` [documentation](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/random/generated/numpy.random.choice.html) (in particular, the `size` and `replace` parameters), and `np.append` [documentation](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.append.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hint**: Your main task is to figure out what to assign to `differences` in the for loop. Take a look at the `np.append` [documentation](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.append.html)!"

    "\n",
    "Use the `plot_distribution` function you defined in an earlier part to plot a histogram of this empirical distribution. Because you are using this function, your histogram should have unit bins, with bars centered at integers. No title or labels are required for this question.\n",
